## About
Basically, this is "Google Books at home".

### History
This came to be from a bootcamp on the basics of web development using React and NodeJS when I got an intership during my final year at university. Too bad I was hired late and only arrived at the very last day of the bootcamp, so all I was left with was a very basic "completed" project (comprised of a simplistic GUI to execute the basic CRUD actions) which I understood almost nothing about, seeing as I had no React knowledge and only basic experience with web development overall.

Later, then, I decided to smooth out the projectâ€™s rough edges while studying React, and ~~the rest is history~~ HOLY MOLY, THANKFULLY GIT REBASE IS A THING, or else this would've run for a Guines entry on the world's biggest spaghetti!

    - `npm i` â€” install all of the back-end node packages;
    - `npm run dev` â€” run the back-end.
- Open *another* terminal window inside `library-website/frontend` and then...

# P.S.
Note to self â€” Never ever again have the brainlet idea of happy-go-lucking a complex application under the guise of "Just for learning, bruv". For fuck sakes, my software development methodologies teacher right now...
